= twitterscour gem

This gem is on Gemcutter, simply type "gem install twitterscour" to install it.

Code is available on github at http://github.com/brentsowers1/twitterscour

Class for retrieving lists of tweets directly from the Twitter web page, not
through the API.  The API that other twitter gems use provides limited results,
this returns all tweets that you can see if you go to the web page direclty.
TwitterScour is the main class to use.  There is no need to instantiate it,
two class methods are provided to search for tweets.  These will return an
array of Tweet objects.

Note that this gem needs the gems HTTParty, Nokogiri, and json_pure.  HTTParty should
install without any trouble when you install this.  For Nokogiri, follow
the instructions here to install if you get an error:
http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html

== Examples:

Get the 40 most recent tweets from me (@sowersb), with location info on all
tweets:
  require 'twitterscour'
  brent_tweets = TwitterScour.from_user('sowersb', 2, true)

Get the 60 most recent tweets with the term Ruby in the tweet.
  require 'twitterscour'
  ruby_tweets = TwitterScour.search_term('Ruby', 3)
