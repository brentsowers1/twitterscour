= twitterscour gem

This gem is on Gemcutter, simply type "gem install twitterscour" to install it.

Code is available on github at http://github.com/brentsowers1/twitterscour

Class for retrieving lists of tweets directly from the Twitter web page, not
through the API.  The API that other twitter gems use returns only what Twitter
considers the "most popular" tweets in many cases, this returns all tweets that
you can see if you go to the web page directly.  TwitterScour is the main class
to use.  There is no need to instantiate it, two class methods are provided to
search for tweets.  These will return an array of Tweet objects.  Location info
can be retrieved on tweets searched for by user name as well.

WARNING - this gem should probably not be relied upon for a production system.
Because it uses the structure of the Twitter web pages as they are now, it could
break if Twitter changes the structure of their web page.  Unlike the API,
Twitter makes no guarantees of consistency for their web pages.

Note that this gem needs the gems HTTParty, Nokogiri, and json_pure.  HTTParty should
install without any trouble when you install this.  For Nokogiri, follow
the instructions here to install if you get an error:

== Examples:

Get the 40 most recent tweets from me (@sowersb), with location info on all
tweets:
  require 'twitterscour'
  brent_tweets = TwitterScour.from_user('sowersb', 2, true)

Get the 60 most recent tweets with the term Ruby in the tweet.
  require 'twitterscour'
  ruby_tweets = TwitterScour.search_term('Ruby', 3)
